# MNIST-Classification-logistic-regression-OPTI-ASS3
An implementation of binary classification for distinguishing between the digits 0/1 and 8/9. We have minimized our cost function using the Gradient Descent and the Exact Newton methods. Step size for these methods was chosen using the Armijo linesearch algorithm.<br />
